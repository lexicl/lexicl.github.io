          <h2>Fake News: What's Really Going On</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Have you ever wondered how to process the insane amount of information you see on a daily basis? Well, you're not alone. Today, we have more information available than ever. It's great to have options, but how do you distinguish the good from the bad? Or even more important: the dishonest from the reputable? First, you must understand a little thing that we call <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=501fNomcD_Y" target="_blank">'Fake News'</a>.

          <h2>Purdue Owl Writing Lab</h2>
          <p class="description">
            To create a website like this, yes, I'll admit, you need to know basic coding, BUT without good writing, you can't do any of this. My professors frequently recommend Purdue Owl Writing Lab for my projects. It always helps me learn more about writing and citations. It's a great resource! Take the first step toward better writing and <a href = "https://owl.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">learn with me!</a>
